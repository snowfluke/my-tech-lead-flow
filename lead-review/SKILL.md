name: lead-review
description: The tech lead's review of a pull request against the project's own coding standards and review checklist, in any language. Discovers the repo's standards docs, checks out the PR branch in an isolated git worktree, runs the project's test / lint / format / type-check gates, proves each finding, then posts a review in a fixed, script-checked format that stays identical across rounds. Also audits commits pushed straight to a branch, as a range from a given commit or as one author's commits in it, with the rounds kept in a GitHub issue. Use when the user asks to review a PR, review a branch, re-review a PR after changes, review commits on main, review an author's commits since a hash, or do code review.

# Lead Review

Review a PR as its tech lead. To review commits that reached a branch without
a PR (a range, or one author's commits in it), follow these steps with the
changes in [references/audit.md](references/audit.md).

What backs a finding sets its severity:

| Severity | Backed by | Can the author argue? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BLOCKER | Proof (a reproduction you ran, or a `file:line` trace), or a written project rule quoted verbatim | No |
| NIT | Neither. It is your preference. | Yes. The author may decline it with a reason. |
| QUESTION | A suspicion that only the author can settle | Not yet. The answer decides. |

Written rules are the checklist, the coding standard, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, specs, ADRs, AC THEN clauses and the PR template. The script enforces the table: a finding with Rule or Proof must be a BLOCKER, and a NIT has neither. Never remove a Rule or Proof to lower a severity. A NIT you raise on PR after PR belongs in a written rule. Write the rule, or stop raising it.

Every review body has the same shape in every round. `scripts/review_body.py` builds the skeleton and checks the result. Do not post a body that the script rejects.

Paths in this file are relative to the directory that holds this `SKILL.md`. Find that directory first, then call each script by its absolute path, because the shell runs in the repo. Use `python3`. The scripts need only the standard library.

## 1. Read the project's standards

Read `README.md` first. Then read `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` if present. Then find the standards. Look in the repo root, `docs/`, `.github/`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

| Looking for | Common names |
| --- | --- |
| Coding standard | `docs/coding-standard/` (a folder), or one file: `CODING_STANDARD(S).md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| Review checklist | `docs/code-review-checklist/` (a folder), or one file: `CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` |
| Architecture / specs | `docs/technical-specs/`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, ADRs under `docs/adr/` |
| Stories / acceptance criteria | `docs/business/`, `USER_STORY.md`, `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md` |
| Task breakdown | `docs/task-breakdown/` (a folder), or `TASK_BREAKDOWN.md` |
| API specs | `docs/api-specs/`, `openapi.*` |

If no standards exist, raise behavior findings only.

## 2. Check out the PR in a worktree

The worktree keeps the user's checkout untouched.

```bash
git fetch origin
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <number> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <number> --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName')
git worktree add "/tmp/pr<number>-review<N>" "origin/$PR_BRANCH"
git worktree add "/tmp/pr<number>-base<N>" "origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
```

Read PR source only from the PR worktree. Read the rules (the standard, the checklist, `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, the specs) only from the base worktree: a PR must not change the rules it is reviewed against. `gh pr diff|view|checks` work from anywhere. For a local branch with no PR, add a worktree for the branch and diff it against the base (`git diff <base>...<branch>`).

## 3. Gather context

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,baseRefName,baseRefOid,headRefOid,files,additions,deletions,commits,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
gh pr diff <number> > /tmp/pr<number>.diff
gh pr checks <number>
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner
```

Step 9 needs `nameWithOwner` and `baseRefOid`.

Save the PR body to a file. Step 5 needs it:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json body --jq .body > /tmp/pr<number>-body.md
```

Save the last posted round. It is the ledger for this round:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json reviews --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.body | startswith("## Round"))] | last | .body // empty' > /tmp/pr<number>-prev.md
```

An empty file means this is Round 1.

## 4. Run the gates

Run the project's own gates in the worktree. Detect the toolchain. Do not assume `npm` or `bun`. Take the first match: a command documented in `CLAUDE.md`, README or `CONTRIBUTING.md`, then a manifest script, then the ecosystem default.

If the project documents no command, use the ecosystem default in [references/gates.md](references/gates.md).

Prefer one aggregate script (`complete-check`, `ci`) if it exists. If a gate cannot run, say so on the Gate line. Do not report a pass you did not see.

## 5. Review

Do each step in order. Write each finding down as you find it.

1. **Checklist.** Print the walk skeleton: `python3 <this skill's dir>/scripts/review_body.py walk <checklist> > /tmp/pr<number>-walk.md`. `<checklist>` is the checklist file, or its folder. Each line keys an item as `<file>:L<line>`. Give every line one verdict: `PASS`, `N/A`, `FAIL F<n>`, or `ASK F<n>`. Every `FAIL F<n>` is an OPEN BLOCKER whose Rule links that checklist line. Use `ASK F<n>` when only the author can tell, for example whether a manual smoke test ran. It points to an OPEN QUESTION. The script checks both directions. If the repo has no checklist, skip the walk and pass `--no-checklist` in step 9.
2. **Trace outside the diff.** For each changed function, middleware, route, config or type, grep its callers and the place it is registered or mounted. Many bugs sit where the changed code is used, not where it is written.
3. **Architecture.** Layering, module structure, file-size limits, duplicated utilities.
4. **Correctness and safety.** Error handling, input validation, auth, transactions, concurrency, secrets, injection.
5. **API contract.** If endpoints changed and specs exist, compare method, path, request, response, status and pagination with the spec. An operation this PR implements has its row in the Operation Status Tracker (`docs/api-specs/_index.md`) set to `OK`.
6. **Acceptance criteria.** Skip this step if the PR cites no AC ID. Run `python3 <this skill's dir>/scripts/check_ac_refs.py /tmp/pr<number>-body.md --business-dir /tmp/pr<number>-review<N>/docs/business`. A non-zero exit lists AC IDs that do not exist. For each cited AC, trace every THEN clause to the code. Match displayed text verbatim, in any language.
7. **Tests.** Each behavior and each cited AC has a test that fails when the behavior breaks. Check each changed test against the project's test rules, including its junk patterns. A match to a written rule is a BLOCKER that quotes the rule. With no written rule, it is a NIT.
8. **PR description.** Check each claim in the description against the diff. A claim the diff does not support is a finding. The diff or the changed-file list is its Proof.
9. **Scope.** If the PR cites a task card, compare each changed file with the card. List every unrelated file in one finding.
10. **Mergeability.** A PR that is not mergeable gets a BLOCKER: rebase on the base branch.
11. **CI.** A check that fails because of the PR is a BLOCKER. A check that also fails on the base branch is not a finding. Name it on the CI line and say which suites did not run.
12. **Prove it.** A BLOCKER needs Proof or a Rule. Without either, it is a NIT. If you suspect a bug and cannot prove it, check who can settle it. If only the author can (intent, a requirement, an external system), ask a QUESTION. If the code can, read the code. Otherwise do not post it.

## 6. Status and verdict

| Status | Set it when | Allowed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OPEN | You raise the finding | All |
| RESOLVED | Its Done when holds on the new head | BLOCKER, NIT |
| DECLINED | The author gave a reason in the PR thread, and you accept it | NIT |
| ANSWERED | The author answered in the PR thread | QUESTION |

Every status except OPEN is final. If an answer shows a bug, raise a new BLOCKER with a new ID. The QUESTION stays ANSWERED.

The verdict rule is the same in every round:

| State | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Any finding is OPEN | `--request-changes` |
| No finding is OPEN | `--approve` |

Nothing merges while a finding is OPEN, so no finding is forgotten. Never end on a plain `--comment`.

## 7. Write the body

Start from the skeleton. Do not write the body from memory.

```bash
# Round 1 (the prev file is empty):
python3 <this skill's dir>/scripts/review_body.py next > /tmp/pr<number>-review.md
# Round 2 and later:
python3 <this skill's dir>/scripts/review_body.py next /tmp/pr<number>-prev.md > /tmp/pr<number>-review.md
```

Fill every `{{...}}` placeholder. Write the file with a file-editing tool. Do not use a shell heredoc, because it breaks backticks. Follow [references/review-format.md](references/review-format.md): the example body, the rules for each field, and the rules for the whole body.

## 8. Later rounds

Round N copies Round N-1. It does not rewrite it. `review_body.py next <prev>` does the copy.

1. Keep every ID, title and severity. They are frozen.
2. Set each status by the table in section 6.
3. A status other than OPEN is final. File a regression or a new problem under a new ID.
4. Give a new finding the next free ID.
5. Keep a section for each OPEN finding. Edit only the fields that the new diff made wrong, usually Where.
6. Detail no closed finding.

## 9. Verify, check, then post

The script checks shape and the checklist walk. It cannot judge the other rule docs, or whether a Fix holds two asks. A verifier in a fresh context judges those.

1. Build the verifier prompt. Pass every rule doc you read in step 1:

   ```bash
   python3 <this skill's dir>/scripts/review_body.py verify-prompt /tmp/pr<number>-review.md --diff /tmp/pr<number>.diff \
     --rules <checklist> <coding standard> <CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md> <each spec a finding cites> > /tmp/pr<number>-verify-prompt.md
   ```

   Each `--rules` entry is a file or a folder. The prompt keeps the diff only for the files the findings cite, and lists the others by name, so it stays small enough for weaker models. Add `--full-diff` to embed everything.

2. Run that prompt in a fresh context: a subagent if your harness has one, otherwise a new session. Never run it in the context that wrote the review. Save its output to `/tmp/pr<number>-verify.md`.
3. Run the check:

   ```bash
   python3 <this skill's dir>/scripts/review_body.py check /tmp/pr<number>-review.md --repo <nameWithOwner> --base <baseRefOid> \
     --walk /tmp/pr<number>-walk.md --checklist <checklist> --verify /tmp/pr<number>-verify.md
   # No checklist in the repo: replace --walk and --checklist with --no-checklist.
   # Round 2 and later: add --prev /tmp/pr<number>-prev.md
   ```

4. Fix every error in the body. A verifier verdict other than `OK` is an error. Any change to the body makes the verification stale, so go back to 1. Two or three passes is normal: a verifier tends to catch one problem per pass.
5. If you judge a verdict wrong, do not edit the body to please it, and do not rerun until it passes. Append `F<n>: OVERRIDE <reason>` below the verifier's lines. Keep the verifier's line. Ask the user to approve each override: quote the verifier line and your reason. Post only after the user approves. The check prints every override as a warning.

Post only when the check prints `OK`.

```bash
gh pr review <number> --request-changes --body-file /tmp/pr<number>-review.md   # a finding is OPEN
gh pr review <number> --approve         --body-file /tmp/pr<number>-review.md   # nothing is OPEN
```

## 10. After posting

- If an OPEN BLOCKER exists and the project's flow expects it, convert the PR to draft: `gh pr ready <number> --undo`.
- Move the linked issue's board card to match the verdict. Run `gh pr view <number> --json closingIssuesReferences,projectItems`. If the PR links an issue on a board, set its `Status` with the board's own column names:
  - Request Changes: move it back to the in-progress column (for example `In Progress`).
  - Approve: move it toward done, per the board's convention. Many boards reach `Done` only on merge.

  Use `gh project item-edit --id <item-id> --field-id <status-field> --project-id <pid> --single-select-option-id <option>`. If no issue or board exists, skip this step. Never create a card.
- Fill in the PR template's reviewer sign-off, per project convention. Do not add a bot or an agent as a human reviewer.
- Remove the worktree and the temp files:

```bash
git worktree remove "/tmp/pr<number>-review<N>" --force
git worktree remove "/tmp/pr<number>-base<N>" --force
rm -f /tmp/pr<number>-review.md /tmp/pr<number>-prev.md /tmp/pr<number>-body.md /tmp/pr<number>.diff /tmp/pr<number>-walk.md /tmp/pr<number>-verify-prompt.md /tmp/pr<number>-verify.md
```
